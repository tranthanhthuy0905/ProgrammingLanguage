# PLP 01 : History and Hello world

### PLP 1: Language overview and setup
Before the end of the first day of class, you should have picked a language that you will learn this semester. Be sure to check with me so that I can approve your choice. Make sure you also put your name on the list (Links to an external site.).  This assignment has 2 parts: History and Getting Started.

####History
Answer the following questions about your programming language:

- What is the name of your language?
- When/where was it created, and by whom? Was it written to address a particular problem or need?
- What types of programming is your language primarily used for (ex: web sites, video games, mobile devices, parsing, etc.)? If your language is multi-purpose, provide some examples of different projects it's been used for.
- Where will you get information about this language when it's time to start programming in it? At the end of your assignment, provide a list of the names of books, website URLs, or any other resources that relate to your language in particular.

####Getting Started
Now that you've picked a language and learned about its history and uses, it's time to actually get it set up and use it.  To do this you must:

- Install your programming language and anything else that it needs to run (a programming environment or something similar)
- Write a "hello world" program in that language (checking the Internet for one is fine but do (3))
- Run the program
- Be prepared to show me that you can run the program during lab
 

Your write-up should address the following questions.  Try to answer them in such a way that someone else would be able to follow your instructions and run your program:

- What did you need to do to install the language?
- Does this language come with a recommended programming environment? What is it?  If not, how did you pick the one that you'll be using?
- How do you run programs in that language?
- How do you write comments in your language?
 

**The answers to the two sets of above questions questions will be put in a GitHub repository that you create**, which you will **send me a link to the repo on the canvas PLP-1 assignment**.  Make sure that your answers are clear, accurate, and fully-formed: remember that these tutorials are public, and GitHub users don't have the context of the assignment that you do.

Explain the reasoning behind the answers as much as possible.  If there is no clear-cut answer to a question, explain why not.  And cite your sources!
